# Introduction

This is an unofficial wrapper for the [Monzo API](https://docs.monzo.com/)
written in TypeScript.

As of now, MonzoJS **does not** handle authentication, and you must already have
your access token in hands. More information can be found in the official Monzo
documentation [here](https://docs.monzo.com/#authentication).

## Installation

With NPM:

```bash
npm i @marceloclp/monzojs
```

Or with yarn:

```bash
yarn add @marceloclp/monzojs
```

## Usage

MonzoJS exports every endpoint individually, as well as a client for convenience
when you need to make many requests.

```ts
import { getTransactions } from '@marceloclp/monzojs'

async () => {
  // Individual endpoints always follow the same signature, with the accepted
  // parameters followed by the access token that you must already have in hands.
  const transactions = await getTransactions('myAccessToken', { limit: 50 })
}
```

Alternatively, you can instanciante `MonzoClient` to avoid passing down your
access token every time.

```ts
import MonzoClient from '@marceloclp/monzojs'

async () => {
  // Access token is passed to client.
  const monzo = MonzoClient('myAccessToken')
  const transactions = await client.getTransactions({ limit: 50 })
  const accounts = await client.getAccounts()
}
```

## Typings

For convenience, the package also exports a **namespace** containing all the
typings returned by the Monzo API:

```ts
import { Monzo } from '@marceloclp/monzojs'

type Account = Monzo.Accounts.RetailAccount
```
